      <h3>City Planning</h3>
      <br>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>With the influx of people to urban centers came the increasingly obvious problem of city layouts.</li>
        <li>Major streets were quite often the original paths beaten by wandering cows and passing travelers before the city was large.</li>
        <li>During the period of Enlightenment Europe, many European rulers and kings took of the task of redesigning their cities to be more efficient,<br>as well as better show of the grandeur of their nation.</li>
        <li>Improvements were made in hygiene and fire safety with wider streets, stone construction and access to water sources.</li>
        <li>Wider streets accounted for more foot traffic</li>
        <li>Railroad tracks were driven into the heart of the city.</li>
        <li>The industrial city still focused on the city center, which contained both the central business district, defined by large office buildings,<br>and substantial numbers of factory and warehouse structures. Both trolleys and railroad systems converged on the center<br>of the city, which boasted the premier entertainment and shopping establishments.<br>The working class lived in crowded districts close to the city center, near their place of employment.</li>
        <li></li>
