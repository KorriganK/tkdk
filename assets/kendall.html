      <h3>Sewage</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b>Public Health Act of 1848</b>
        <br>A serious outbreak of cholera prompted British government to finally take action and fix the problem
        <br>It allowed towns to:
        <br>1. Set up their own local Board of Health
        <br>2. Appoint a local medical officer
        <br>3. Organize the removal of rubbish
        <br>4. Build a working sewer system<br>
        <br><b>New Cholera Outbreak in 1866</b>
        <br>Since it was after new advances in better hygiene, towns enforcing the new laws were least affected.<br>
        <br><b>1870's</b>
        <br>Joseph Chamberlain, the mayor of Birmingham took action<br>to reduce rubbish and disease by demolishing over 40 acres of slums<br>
        <br><b>Public Health Act of 1875</b>
        <br>Local authorities responsible for:
        <br>1. Clean water
        <br>2. Public toilets
        <br>3. Rubbish removal
        <br>4. Sewers and drains<br>
        <br><b>The Great Stink of 1858</b>
        <br>Plans for a new sewer system in London were being made
        <br>Extremely hot weather meant Thames River level was VERY low,<br>exposing the sewage along its banks causing a horrible stench
        <br>Parliament was not able to meet due to the conditions
