        About the time of the American Revolution, the people of England began to use machines to make cloth and steam engines to run the machines.<br>A little later they invented locomotives. Productivity began a spectacular climb.<br>By 1850 most Englishmen were laboring in industrial towns,<br>and Great Britain had become the workshop of the world.<br>From Britain the Industrial Revolution spread gradually,<br>throughout Europe and to the United States.

        The most important of the machines that ushered in the Industrial Revolution were invented in the last third of the 18th century.<br>Earlier in the century, however, three inventions had been made which opened the way for the later machines.<br>One was the crude, slow-moving steam engine built by Thomas Newcomen (1705),<br>which was used to pump water out of mines. The second was John Kay's flying shuttle (1733).<br>It enabled one person to handle a wide loom,<br>more rapidly than two persons could operate it before.<br>The third was a frame for spinning cotton thread with rollers,<br>first set up by Lewis Paul and John Wyatt (1741).<br>Their invention was not commercially practical,<br>but it was the first step toward solving the problem of machine spinning.
